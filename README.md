# Personal Portfolio - React

This personal portfolio is built with React and bundled using parcel offering a showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. The portfolio includes three main pages: Home, About, and Projects, providing visitors with a comprehensive view of my work.

## Features

- React-based: Utilizes the React library for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- Multi-page Navigation: Consists of multiple pages, including Home, About, and Projects, accessible through seamless navigation.
- Lazy-loaded Images: Implements lazy loading of images on the Projects page using the Intersection Observer API, enhancing performance by loading images only when they come into the user's viewport.

## Pages

### Home

The Home page welcomes visitors with an introduction, highlighting key skills and a brief overview of my expertise. It sets the tone for exploring the rest of the portfolio.

### About

The About page provides an in-depth look into my background, education, experiences, and interests. It aims to give visitors a better understanding of who I am and what drives me professionally.

### Projects

The Projects page showcases a collection of my notable projects. It utilizes lazy loading of images, ensuring faster initial page load by loading project images only when they enter the viewport. Each project is accompanied by a description, technologies used, a link to the source code and a link to view the project.
